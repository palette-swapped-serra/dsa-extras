# ------- LABELING -------
type Music16
    16 value values:Music # enum is game-specific.

# Used for the Sound Room. We *could* just use a 16-bit value with 16 bits of
# padding, but the code clearly treats the value as 32-bit. The list
# terminator has a value of -1, so we need to specify that it's signed; but we
# don't list -1 in the enum values because using it explicitly would interfere
# with DSA's handling of terminators.
# Presumably it works the same way in FE8 - don't have documentation.
type Music32
    32 value values:Music signed

# ------- PRIORITY -------
type MusicPriority
# These values seem to be pairs of identical 2-byte numbers.
