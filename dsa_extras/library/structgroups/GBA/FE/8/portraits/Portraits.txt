# FE8 main portraits are uncompressed, but headered.
# Presumably they get passed to the routine that checks a common 4-byte
# header for a compression routine (00 = none, 10 = lz77 etc.).
# The header indicates a size of 0x1004 bytes: apparently 0x1000 bytes of
# data plus the 4 header bytes themselves. Curiously, the header *is* counted
# here, but not in the lz77 headers.
