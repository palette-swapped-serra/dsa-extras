# https://feuniverse.us/t/trap-event-data-notes/2309

# Old EA raws had the "first active turn" and "delay" as a coordinate,
# believed to represent the "size of the trap". Gryz's notes indicate this is
# wrong; instead it's the first turn on which the trap can activate, and a
# number of turns between potential activations (1 = can always activate).
# IOW, it works the same way as the timing data for event triggers.

BALLISTA
# Ballista data.
    Byte:1
    ByteCoord Position
    ItemID Type
    Pair:0 # Ballistae are controlled by units, so timing doesn't apply.

# 2: destructible terrain (but it's implemented by a separate system instead)
# 3: ?

FIRE
# Fire trap.
    Byte:4
    ByteCoord Position
    Byte:0
    Turn Active

GAS
# Poison gas trap.
    Byte:5
    ByteCoord Position
    Byte Direction
    Turn Active

# 6: alternating tile changes (FE6 water temple)

ARROW
# Light arrow trap. Appears in FE8 data???
    Byte:7
    ByteCoord Position
    Byte:0 # hard-coded to fire downwards.
    Turn Active

# 8: "instant fire"
# 9: spear trap?
# 10: torch staff beacon
# 11: mine

EGG
# Gorgon egg (based on where it occurs in FE8 data).
# Would supposedly make light runes in FE6/FE7, if it worked.
    Byte:12
    ByteCoord Position
    Byte:0
    Turn Active
